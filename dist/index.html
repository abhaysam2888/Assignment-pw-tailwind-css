                    <span class="font-bold font-sans text-lg">Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple Inc.</span>, was an iconic figure who left an indelible mark on the world of technology and innovation. Born on February 24, 1955, his journey from humble beginnings to becoming one of the most influential entrepreneurs of our time is a testament to his relentless pursuit of excellence.

                    Jobs' innate sense of design and aesthetics revolutionized the way we interact with technology. He believed that simplicity and elegance were the keys to creating exceptional products. Under his leadership, Apple introduced groundbreaking devices such as the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which redefined entire industries and transformed the way we communicate, listen to music, and consume media.</p>

                        <p class="w-[700px]">One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people. "Look at the results," he replied. "These are all smart people I work with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they don't." Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, "And we got some amazing things done." Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion-not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four children.</p>
